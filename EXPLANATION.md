## Brief

I had only mainly worked on the following files:

- index.html
- main.css
- script.js

I ran across an error when trying to run
```
$ npm install
```
The installation repetedly hangs and displays `still install loadalldepsintoidealtree` and that affected my ability to work with the server and node. Additionally, since I had learnt to implement a server once in the past, I know, even if I got the server running, I would have trouble integrating it completely within the given timeframe.

I wasn't able to meet all the requirements and have stated the features I added below.

## Libraries & Frameworks Used

- Bootstrap
- jQueryUI for implementing dragging and resizing
- FitText to enable font resizing


## Features

Below are the basic features I have added:

- Displaying images into the canvas and asset section when the user selects it
- Resizing of images and text
- Dragging of images and text
- Added some color to the page

## Challenges 

I had come across many challenges during this test and have listed them below

- I couldn't integrate the server due to the issue I mentioned above and the solutions available online didn't help my case
- I couldn't implement the dragging of images from the sidepane to the canvas and instead added them directly
- I wasn't able to natively implement the dragging and resizing, so I had to use some frameworks.
- The elements in the canvas don't provide perfect user experience because at times the images are pushed out of the canvas and even moved around when neighboring elements are resized.
- Trying to get this page working was difficult to balance between my classes and other commitments but I was eager to give it my best.

## Retrospection

I am really happy to work on this test and get some funcitonality up, which I am not very used to. I would have hoped to integrate the server and also store and load images from a folder. Considering the challenges, I am happy to have gotten this far and know that with my passion and interest in this field, I would be able to learn further and develop a much better solution. Projects like this push me to max out my ability and further improve by learning, failing, and trying again.
